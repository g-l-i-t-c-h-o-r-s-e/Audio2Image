This script converts your audio into an umcompressed format and then encodes it into an uncompressed image, so that you can apply image/video filters to the data and databend it.
Also included are two other methods of doing this process, as well as the ability to bake/convert the output image back into a sharable audio file with the format of your choice.

# Setup:
Unzip ffmpeg3.3.2.zip and place ffmpeg3.3.2.exe in the same folder as this script.                                                                                                                    
Download, unzip and place all three of these .exes in the same folder as well
